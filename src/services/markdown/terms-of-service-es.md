# Spacespot User Terms

1.  Introduction.

    1. The website www.spacespot.com (**"Website"**) offers an online advertisement platform (the **"Platform"**) allowing providers (**"Provider"**) to publish details relating to commercial real estate for rent/lease or other use (**"Property"**) on the Website (the **“Listing”**), and the electronic execution of an agreement (**"Agreement"**) between a Provider and a potential or actual client (**"Client"**) relating to such Property. Provider or Client referred as **"you"**.

    2. The Website and Platform is operated by CBRE AS (**"CBRE"**) or **"we"** or **"us"**.

    3. These user terms (the **"Terms"**) govern the use of and access to the Website and the Platform,
       and the services offered through the Platform, being:

       1. access for Providers to upload Listings, for Clients to view Listings, and for both parties to negotiate a prospective rental or usage;

       2. access to market standard terms which the Provider and Client may choose to incorporate into the Agreement;

       3. a mechanism to electronically execute an Agreement which has been agreed between the Provider and Client; and

       4. access for the Client to a Spacespot advisor who will provide advice on process, technical and market matters, (together with the Website and the Platform, the **“Services”**).

    4. If you decide to engage us to carry out any other services for you, which are advertised to you through the Platform but which are not listed above as Services, you may be asked to accept other specific terms & conditions relating to such additional services. For example, Providers may utilise our Spacespot broker resource to assist with transactions, viewings and document negotiation, which will be subject to an additional fee and your acceptance of additional terms and conditions.

    5. No CBRE officer, director, employee, member or consultant contracts with you directly or assumes any legal responsibility to you personally in respect of the Services. All correspondence and other outputs sent to you in the course of our agreement with you shall for all purposes be treated as having been sent by CBRE.

    6. These Terms also incorporate our Data Processing Terms included as the Appendix.

    7. For the avoidance of doubt, these Terms are not intended to apply to any regulated activities on the Platform whatsoever, for example broker resources, which will be governed by separate terms should the parties choose to engage in any such regulated activities.

2.  No agency

    1. CBRE is only a technical provider or the Services. CBRE does not supply, own, offer, sell, resell or deliver the Services, including a particular Listing, as a real estate agent. The Provider has sole responsibility for its Listings and the negotiation and execution of an Agreement, and the parties acknowledge that CBRE is in no way acting as an agent for either the Provider or the Client.

    2. The Agreement is an independent agreement between the Provider and the Client to which the parties acknowledge CBRE is not a party.

3.  Acceptance of Terms and creation of User Account

    1. In order to access our Services (except when visiting the Website only to browse Listings) you must register and create a user account (the **"User Account"**). Only individuals with rights to legally represent and act on behalf of a Provider or Client (**"Authorised User"**) may create a User Account on behalf of a Provider or Client. By creating a User Account, you and the Authorised User each warrant that you have the authority to create such an account in accordance with these Terms. The Provider, the Client and each Authorized User is responsible for maintaining the confidentiality and security of the user ID(s) and password(s) associated with the use of the Services and shall be fully responsible for any and all activities, which occur under such user ID(s) and password(s).

    2. Any other service offered by CBRE may be subject to separate terms and conditions and must be agreed upon separately.

## Appendix

Data Processing Terms

**“Data Protection Legislation”** means the regulation on the protection of natural person with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data known as the General Data Protection Regulation ((EU) 2016/679) and any national legislation implementing such regulation or otherwise related to data protection and privacy.
**"Processing"**, **“Data Subject”**, **“Personal Data”** (**“Data”**), **“Personal Data Breach”**, **“Supervisory Authority”**, **"Controller"** and **"Processor"** shall have the meaning given to it in the Data Protection Legislation.

1. **Compliance with law:** Both parties shall comply with all applicable requirements of the Data Protection Legislation. This paragraph 1 is in addition to, and does not relieve, remove or replace, a party’s obligations under the Data Protection Legislation.

2. **Relationship of the parties:** The parties acknowledge that the Client is the controller and CBRE is the processor. To the extent not stated elsewhere in this Agreement the details of processing are as follows:

   1. **Subject matter of the Processing:** To provide Spacespot to the Client.

   2. **Duration of the processing:** As required in order to provide Spacespot, or as otherwise required by law.

   3. **Nature and purpose of the Processing:** Cloud storage of documents and provision of negotiation services.

   4. **Types of Data being Processed:** Data as found in uploaded documents (e.g. leases containing names).

3. **CBRE responsibilities:** Without prejudice to the generality of paragraph 1, CBRE shall, in relation to any Data processed in connection with the performance by CBRE of its obligations under this Agreement:

   1. process that Data only on the documented instructions of the Client to perform its obligations under this Agreement and ensure that its personnel and those of its Sub- Processors (defined below) only process Data on instructions from the Client, unless required to do otherwise by applicable law.

   2. ensure that its personnel and personnel of any Sub-Processors who are authorised to process Data have committed themselves to confidentiality or are under an appropriate statutory obligation of confidentiality;

   3. taking into account the state of the art, the costs of implementation and the nature, scope, context and purposes of the processing as well as the risk of varying likelihood and severity for the rights and freedoms of natural persons, implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to that risk. In assessing the appropriate level of security, CBRE shall, in particular, take into account the risk that are presented by the processing, in particular from unauthorised or unlawful processing, accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure of, or access to the Data transmitted, stored or otherwise processed.

   4. not appoint any additional third party, including consultant, sub-contractor, agent or professional adviser or other third party which may receive and/or have access to Data (**"Sub-Processor"**), without the prior general written authorisation of the Client subject to CBRE:

      1. ignoring the Client of any intended replacement of a Sub-Processor and gives the Client 10 business days to object to such appointment or replacement;

      2. putting in place written contractual obligations with each Sub-Processor which are substantially similar to the obligations imposed on CBRE pursuant to this Appendix; and

      3. remaining liable to the Client for any failure of any such Sub-Processor to comply with such substantially similar data protection obligations.

   5. taking into account the nature of the Processing by CBRE, reasonably assist the Client with its obligations, insofar as is possible and by appropriate technical and organisational measures, to respond to: (i) any request from a data subject to exercise any of its rights under the Data Protection Legislation (including its rights of access, correction, objection, erasure and data portability, as applicable); and (ii) any other correspondence, enquiry or complaint received from a data subject, regulator or other third party in connection with the processing of Data, such as these relate to the Data processed by CBRE on behalf of Client under the Agreement. In the event that any such request, correspondence, enquiry or complaint is made directly to CBRE, CBRE shall promptly inform the Client, providing full details of the same;

   6. provide reasonable cooperation to the Client in connection with any data protection impact assessment and/or supervisory authority consultation that may be required under the Data Protection Legislation. For the avoidance of doubt, such assistance shall be strictly limited to the processing of Data by CBRE on behalf of Client under the Agreement, taking into account the nature of the processing and the information available to CBRE;

   7. if it becomes aware of a confirmed Personal Data Breach, inform the Client without undue delay and shall provide reasonable information and cooperation to the Client so that the Client can fulfil any data breach reporting obligations it may have under the Data Protection Legislation.

   8. at the written election of the Client, and to the extent technically feasible, either:

      1. securely destroy the Data (including all copies of it); or

      2. return the Data (including all copies of it) to the Client in the format required by the Client (at the Client’s cost); upon termination or expiry of this Agreement, provided that CBRE may retain a copy of the Data where required by applicable law; and

   9. no more than once in any 12 month period, unless otherwise required by a Supervisory Authority or where the Client reasonably suspects non-compliance with this Appendix, provide all information reasonably necessary to demonstrate CBRE's and any Sub-Processor's compliance with this Appendix and/or allow the Client and/or its authorised representatives, upon no less than 15 business days' prior written notice to CBRE, reasonable access during normal business hours to any relevant premises and documents to inspect the procedures and measures referred to in this Appendix. Such audits shall be at the Client’s cost, provided that if such audit reveals that CBRE breached this Appendix, then CBRE shall bear all such costs. In addition, such audits shall be carried out with the minimum disruption possible to CBRE’s operations and where the Client or its authorised representative signs CBRE's standard confidentiality agreement.

   10. If CBRE is aware that or of the opinion that any instruction given by the Client in accordance with paragraph 4.9 infringes the Data Protection Legislation or other applicable law, CBRE shall immediately inform the Client of this giving details of the potential infringement;

4. International data transfers:

   1. For the purposes of paragraphs 4.2 and 4.3:

      1. "Europe"means(i)theMemberStatesofthe European Economic Area, and (ii) with immediate effect following its withdrawal from the European Union, the United Kingdom.

      2. "UK and EU Data Protection Law" means the Data Protection Legislation and any and all applicable UK data protection laws (including the Data Protection Act 2018, as may be amended or superseded following the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union)

   2. CBRE shall not transfer the Data to (nor permit the Data to be processed in or from) a country outside of Europe unless it takes such measures as are necessary to ensure the transfer is in compliance with UK and EU Data Protection Law (including, where applicable, such measures as are described in paragraph 4.3).

   3. If and when European Union law ceases to apply to the United Kingdom upon the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union then:

      1. to the extent that the Data is subject to the Data Protection Legislation by virtue of European Union law, CBRE shall not transfer the Data to (nor permit the Data to be processed in or from) the United Kingdom unless it takes such measures as are necessary to ensure the transfer is in compliance with the Data Protection Legislation; and

      2. CBRE shall not transfer the Data to (nor permit the Data to be processed in or from) a country outside of Europe unless it complies with the requirements of paragraph 4.2.
