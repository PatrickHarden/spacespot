**Vendors and Service Providers**

CBRE may share your personal data with companies acting as our authorised agents and service providers. Because CBRE operates globally, we may transfer your information to countries or jurisdictions that do not provide the same level of data protection as the country in which you reside. If we make such a transfer we will, or our service providers and vendors will, as applicable, provide safeguards appropriate to any applicable laws. See International Data Transfers, below, for more information.

Such third parties may include:

If CBRE is merged with another organization, or in the event of a transfer of our assets or operations, CBRE may disclose or transfer your personal data in connection with such transaction.

## HOW CBRE WILL SECURE YOUR PERSONAL DATA

We use appropriate technical and organizational security measures to safeguard the personal data we collect and process about you from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed. These security measures are designed to provide a level of security appropriate to the risk. We also have a process to address and remediate any suspected personal data breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator in the event of a breach where we are legally required to do so.

## INTERNATIONAL DATA TRANSFERS

CBRE is a global business. We may transfer the personal information we collect about you to recipients, and your personal information may be stored and processed, in countries other than the country in which the information was originally collected, including the United States and elsewhere that may have less stringent data protection laws than the country in which you initially provided the information.
When we transfer your information to countries other than the country in which the information was originally collected, we will protect your information as described in this Notice and will comply with all applicable data protection laws in making such transfers.

**If you are located outside the United States, the transfer of personal information is necessary to provide you with the requested information and/or to perform any requested service. To the extent permitted by law, such submission also constitutes your consent for the cross-border transfer.**

With respect to transfers originating from the European Economic Area to the United States and other non-EEA jurisdictions:

- CBRE US affiliates are EU-US and Swiss-US Privacy Shield certified, and

- CBRE has executed EU Standard Contractual Clauses with respect to personal information collected in the European Economic Area and transferred to CBRE in the United States and elsewhere.

Where allowed by applicable law, you may ask for further information on the safeguards that we have put in place to safeguard the transfer of your data to outside of the EEA by contacting us as indicated below.

**Privacy Shield Certification:**

CBRE complies with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss – U.S. Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding personal information that is collected by CBRE affiliates or corporate customers located in the European Economic Area and/or United Kingdom and/or Switzerland and transferred to CBRE, Inc. and its wholly owned US-based affiliates, which include CBRE Global Investors LLC, CBRE GWS Puerto Rico Inc., CBRE Clarion Securities LLC, CBRE Security Services, Inc., CBRE Heery Inc., CBRE HMF, Inc., CBRE Multifamily Capital, Inc., CBRE Capital Markets, Inc., CBRE Technical Services, LLC, CBRE Hana Operations, LLC, Forum Analytics, LLC and Trammell Crow Company LLC in the United States (“CBRE US”).

CBRE is required to disclose personal information in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements. CBRE may, as disclosed above in How We Share Your Personal Data, transfer personal information onward to third parties. CBRE remains liable under the Privacy Shield Principles if a third party processes such personal information in a manner inconsistent with the Principles, unless we prove we are not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.

## YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS

The privacy laws in many countries grant you certain rights concerning your personal data. CBRE honours requests to exercise rights granted to you by applicable law.

### European Economic Area

If we collect or process your data in the context of our operations within the European Economic Area, you have the following rights under Regulation 2016/679, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR):

- The right to request access to your data
- The right to request a copy of your data in a portable format

To exercise any of these rights, please submit a request through our

or contact us at dsr@cbre.com.

If you do not receive a timely response to your request or are not satisfied with the response you receive, you have the right to file a complaint with the applicable Data Protection Authority.
A list of Data Protection Authorities is
[available](https://edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/board/members_en)
from the European Data Protection Board.

### California

As a consumer residing in the state of the State of California, you have the right under the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) to request that: (i) CBRE discloses the categories of Personal Information that we collected, the categories of the sources of such Personal Information, the business or commercial purposes for collecting such Personal Information, the categories of third parties to whom we disclosed such Personal Information, and/or, if we sold or disclosed your Personal Information, the categories of Personal Information that each category of recipient purchased or obtained, and/or (ii) that we provide you with copies of such Personal Information. You may make two such (2) requests in any 12-month period.

Subject to certain exceptions, you may also request that we delete any Personal Information about you that we may hold. We may have grounds to deny your deletion request as provided for in the CCPA.

**Upon receipt of your request to know, for access, or for deletion, we will need to reasonably verify that you are the person about whom we collected Personal Information**. We may do so by asking for additional information (“Verifiable Information”) to compare against the information we hold about you, or if you have an account with us, by asking you to log in to that account. We will only use Verifiable Information to verify your identity or authority to make the request. We may also ask you to provide additional detail or clarify your request to allow us to properly understand, evaluate and respond to it.

Types of Verifiable Information we may ask for depend on the context of your relationship with CBRE, but may include:

- Name of a CBRE employee with whom you interacted,
- Date or other details of a transaction you had with CBRE,
- Email address, phone number, or other contact information we may have on file for you.

You may exercise your rights to know, access, delete or opt out by completing the form in our
[Data Subject Rights Portal](https://dsr.cbre.com/)
or by calling us at +1 (866) 428 4722. We will ask for your name, email address, and your relationship to us in order to begin processing your request.

You may authorise someone to submit a rights request on your behalf. You may do this by providing that person with power of attorney pursuant to the California Probate Code. Alternatively, you may provide that person with signed, written permission to submit requests on your behalf, but we will still require you to verify your identity with us directly by one of the methods listed above. In either case, we will also require that person to verify their personal identity via one of the above methods, or, in the case of a business entity, by response to communications directed at a well-known internet domain associated with that business or to contacts provided in that entity’s official filings with the California Secretary of State.

### Elsewhere

You may also have rights under applicable law to request to review, access, correct, delete, port or object to our processing your personal information processed by us. If so, you may do so by making a request on CBRE’s
[Data Subject Rights Portal](https://dsr.cbre.com/)
or submitting your request to dsr@cbre.com. If we do not respond to your satisfaction, you may also have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority. Information on privacy laws and supervisory authorities around the world is
